# Fixtures

These folders contain the fixtures for our [unit tests](../../../../docs/maintainers/overview.md#unit-tests) which are verified by [TemplateUnitSpec.scala](../../scala/uk/gov/hmrc/govukfrontend/views/TemplateUnitSpec.scala)

## `test-fixtures/`

Generated automatically using examples available from the govuk design system.

## `additional-fixtures/`

Generated manually using x-gov-component-renderer to maintain additional test coverage beyond govuk design system examples.

## `patched-fixtures/`

Manually maintained coverage for any scenarios where we have chosen to diverge from the govuk components.
