# Upgrading play-frontend-govuk

## Basic Steps

1. Go to [webjars.org](https://webjars.org) and add the hmrc-frontend webjar by the following steps:
 - Click `Add a WebJar`
 - Select `WebJar Type` as `NPM`
 - Input `hmrc-frontend` and select the relevant version from the dropdown
 - Hit `Deploy!`
2. Bump webjar [dependency](https://github.com/hmrc/hmrc-frontend/tags) for `hmrc-frontend` in `project/LibDependencies.scala`.
3. Generate fixtures folder `src/test/resources/fixtures/test-fixtures`.
   - With the template renderer running locally (see below), execute `sbt generateUnitTestFixtures` 
4. Run unit tests: `sbt clean test`.
5. Start integration test dependencies: .
6. Run integration tests: `sbt clean it:test`.
7. Compare the two versions of `hmrc-frontend` (outgoing vs incoming) using a diff tool as shown [below](#examining-components-for-failed-tests).

### Comparing Differences
Since some of the components have dependencies, it is easier to start upgrading by starting from components with no dependencies, or, alternatively, from the components on the bottom of a dependency graph, and work our way up.

We should first look at the components for which tests failed. It is also important to verify that there are no changes in the other components which were not flagged up by failing tests. Again, this situation might be mitigated by increasing test coverage with generative testing.

#### Examining Components for Failed Tests
 
For each failed test, make a diff between the revisions of the affected component for the old hmrc-frontend version and the new one.

Ex: For upgrading from `v1.4.0` to `v1.5.0`: https://github.com/hmrc/hmrc-frontend/compare/v1.4.0...v1.5.0

If there are many moved/renamed files, the heuristics used by git/github to detect such changes may not be accurate, and it is better to use an appropriate diff tool to perform the comparisons.

The important files to diff are the `.yaml` files describing the component's interface and the component's Nunjucks template implementation, usually named `template.njk`.

Ex:

Assuming we setup an appropriate diff tool to use with git, the following example shows how to diff the `.yaml` and `template.njk` files for a given component. Instructions for using `IntelliJ`â€™s diff and merge tool with `git` can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/rambabusaravanan/1d1902e599c9c680319678b0f7650898).

Given revisions for `hmrc-frontend v1.4.0` of `df35695` and `hmrc-frontend v1.5.0` of `dcfad17`:

```bash
git difftool df35695:src/components/page-heading/page-heading.yaml dcfad17:src/components/page-heading/page-heading.yaml

git difftool df35695:src/components/page-heading/template.njk dcfad17:src/components/page-heading/template.njk
```

#### Looking at Other Components

Now we should verify all the other components for differences and improve test coverage in case those differences were
not detected by the tests.

Ex: For the `file-upload` govuk-frontend component there was a new parameter added but none of the test cases detected the change because 
of insufficient test coverage.
```bash
git diff 8370f97:src/components/file-upload/file-upload.yaml                 3ef1d76:src/govuk/components/file-upload/file-upload.yaml
```

```diff
diff --git a/src/components/file-upload/file-upload.yaml b/src/govuk/components/file-upload/file-upload.yaml
index 51d2d346..713db75d 100644

#### Adding New Components
When running the above steps, there will be test failures if existing components have changed. However, there will be no
failures for new components which have been added to `hmrc-frontend` but which have not yet been implemented in 
`play-frontend-hmrc`.

Therefore, it is important to look at the diffs between versions of `govuk-frontend`, and read the changelog.

To add a new component in `play-frontend-hmrc`, the following steps need to be followed:
- Add the view model as a Scala case class in the folder: `src/main/scala/uk/gov/hmrc/hmrcfrontend/views/viewmodels`
- Add an alias to the view model in `src/main/scala/uk/gov/hmrc/hmrcfrontend/views/Aliases.scala`
- Add the Twirl template in the folder: `src/main/twirl/uk/gov/hmrc/hmrcfrontend/views/components`
- Add to the package objects in: `src/main/scala/uk/gov/hmrc/hmrcfrontend/views/html/components/package.scala`
- Add the template unit test: `src/test/scala/uk/gov/hmrc/hmrcfrontend/views/components`. This should extend 
`TemplateUnitSpec[YourViewModel]("yourTwirlTemplate")`
- Add the template integration test: `src/it/scala/uk/gov/hmrc/hmrcfrontend/views/components`. This should extend
`TemplateIntegrationSpec[YourViewModel]("yourTwirlTemplate")`. You will need to create new Generator
classes in `src/test/scala/uk/gov/hmrc/hmrcfrontend/views/viewmodels`
